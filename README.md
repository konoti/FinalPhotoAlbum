# FinalPhotoAlbum

Steps to get going

npm install
   
node server.js
   
This was built with a MySQL database, so you will need to install MySQL and then run the schema.sql file (copy/paste) directly into it. It will essentially create 1 database with 3 tables (Albums, Photos, Users) this can then be used to test the application.

It will also be deployed to heroku and added here
